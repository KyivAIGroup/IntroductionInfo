# About Us

We are a group of people who professionally work with the task of understanding the theoretical principles of intelligence with the aim for practical implementation. We keep in mind but are not focused on the machine learning and deep learning approach, and feeling unsatisfied, looking more broadly including neuroscience, principles of self-organization and information theory.

The goal of creating general artificial intelligence is long term, but we proceed by solving many basic, even toy problems with the idea of further integration and scaling to complex tasks. We are immune to the disease of over self-importance and do not fear to work with a neural network with 100-1000 neurons even when other try to work with millions. We have several ongoing projects with continuous updates of ideas, results, and unsolved tasks. We are open to collaboration and invite everyone to join the group.
